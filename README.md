## Overview

This module provides functions and facts that are out of scope for [stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib).
Some of them are even intrinsically tied to stdlib.

## Setup

```console
 % puppet module install puppet-extlib
```

## Usage

Since `puppet/extlib` version 3, all functions are provided under the `extlib` namespace.
Non namespaced versions were removed in version 5.

All functions are documented in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

### Facts

All facts in this module are namespaced and begin `extlib__`.
Facter 4 users can also find all facts under a single `extlib` toplevel
structured fact.

#### `extlib__puppet_config` (or `extlib['puppet_config']` when using facter 4)

A fact to expose puppet.conf settings. These are resolved on the agent, (unlike
`$settings::<setting_name>` which is resolved on the puppet master).

The following sections/settings are included.

```
{
  main => {
    hostpubkey,
    hostprivkey,
    hostcert,
    localcacert,
    ssldir,
    vardir,
    server,
  },
  master => {
    localcacert,
    ssldir,
  }
}
```

### EPP Templates

You can include a standardized comment header in your `.epp` or `.erb` templates with the following:
```puppet
<%= scope.call_function('epp', ["extlib/puppet_managed.epp"]) %>
```
The EPP template takes the following optional parameters:
- String  $message = 'WARNING This file is managed by puppet. Do not edit!',
- String  $begin_line = '#',
- String  $end_line = '',
- Int     $line_length = 70,
- String  $metadata_title = 'Metadata:',
- Hash    $metadata = {}
Example:
```puppet
<%= scope.call_function('epp', ["extlib/puppet_managed.epp"], {'metadata' => {'fqdn' => $::fqdn}}) %>
```
Should produce
```shell
#
#
# WARNING This file is managed by puppet. Do not edit!
#
# Metadata:
#  fqdn=hostname.example.com
#
#
```

## Limitations

Some functions require puppetlabs-stdlib (>= 4.6.0) and all functions are only
compatible with Puppet 4.7 and later.

## Development

We highly welcome new contributions to this module, especially those that
include documentation, and rspec tests ;) but will happily guide you through
the process, so, yes, please submit that pull request!

Reference documentation is generated using puppet-strings.
To regenerate it, please run the rake task as follows.

```console
bundle exec rake reference
```
